## AMK Editor
I'm planning to update to 1.1.1 here soon, which will allow the program to utilize the Windows "Open with..." function, and will allow playing animations even if no WAV file is associated with them.
Py2Exe currently has an issue involving the "Open with..." function. The creator has been notified and they are looking into it, once the problem is resolved I will build 1.1.1.
AMK Editor is written in Python 3.7.9. Newer versions of Py2Exe that extend use to 3.7 can be found here: https://github.com/albertosottile/py2exe
